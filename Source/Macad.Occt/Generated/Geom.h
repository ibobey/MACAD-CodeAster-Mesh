/// <summary>
/// Describes a rational or non-rational Bezier curve
/// - a non-rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of
/// poles (also called control points),
/// - a rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of
/// poles with varying weights.
/// These data are manipulated by two parallel arrays:
/// - the poles table, which is an array of gp_Pnt points, and
/// - the weights table, which is an array of reals.
/// The bounds of these arrays are 1 and "the number of "poles" of the curve.
/// The poles of the curve are "control points" used to deform the curve.
/// The first pole is the start point of the curve, and the
/// last pole is the end point of the curve. The segment
/// that joins the first pole to the second pole is the
/// tangent to the curve at its start point, and the
/// segment that joins the last pole to the
/// second-from-last pole is the tangent to the curve at its end point.
/// It is more difficult to give a geometric signification to
/// the weights but they are useful for providing the exact
/// representations of arcs of a circle or ellipse.
/// Moreover, if the weights of all poles are equal, the
/// curve is polynomial; it is therefore a non-rational
/// curve. The non-rational curve is a special and
/// frequently used case. The weights are defined and
/// used only in the case of a rational curve.
/// The degree of a Bezier curve is equal to the number
/// of poles, minus 1. It must be greater than or equal to
/// 1. However, the degree of a Geom_BezierCurve
/// curve is limited to a value (25) which is defined and
/// controlled by the system. This value is returned by the function MaxDegree.
/// The parameter range for a Bezier curve is [ 0, 1 ].
/// If the first and last control points of the Bezier curve
/// are the same point then the curve is closed. For
/// example, to create a closed Bezier curve with four
/// control points, you have to give the set of control
/// points P1, P2, P3 and P1.
/// The continuity of a Bezier curve is infinite.
/// It is not possible to build a Bezier curve with negative
/// weights. We consider that a weight value is zero if it
/// is less than or equal to gp::Resolution(). We
/// also consider that two weight values W1 and W2 are equal if:
/// |W2 - W1| <= gp::Resolution().
/// Warning
/// - When considering the continuity of a closed Bezier
/// curve at the junction point, remember that a curve
/// of this type is never periodic. This means that the
/// derivatives for the parameter u = 0 have no
/// reason to be the same as the derivatives for the
/// parameter u = 1 even if the curve is closed.
/// - The length of a Bezier curve can be null.

/// <summary>
/// Describes a rational or non-rational Bezier surface.
/// - A non-rational Bezier surface is defined by a table
/// of poles (also known as control points).
/// - A rational Bezier surface is defined by a table of
/// poles with varying associated weights.
/// This data is manipulated using two associative 2D arrays:
/// - the poles table, which is a 2D array of gp_Pnt, and
/// - the weights table, which is a 2D array of reals.
/// The bounds of these arrays are:
/// - 1 and NbUPoles for the row bounds, where
/// NbUPoles is the number of poles of the surface
/// in the u parametric direction, and
/// - 1 and NbVPoles for the column bounds, where
/// NbVPoles is the number of poles of the surface
/// in the v parametric direction.
/// The poles of the surface, the "control points", are the
/// points used to shape and reshape the surface. They
/// comprise a rectangular network of points:
/// - The points (1, 1), (NbUPoles, 1), (1,
/// NbVPoles) and (NbUPoles, NbVPoles)
/// are the four parametric "corners" of the surface.
/// - The first column of poles and the last column of
/// poles define two Bezier curves which delimit the
/// surface in the v parametric direction. These are
/// the v isoparametric curves corresponding to
/// values 0 and 1 of the v parameter.
/// - The first row of poles and the last row of poles
/// define two Bezier curves which delimit the surface
/// in the u parametric direction. These are the u
/// isoparametric curves corresponding to values 0
/// and 1 of the u parameter.
/// It is more difficult to define a geometrical significance
/// for the weights. However they are useful for
/// representing a quadric surface precisely. Moreover, if
/// the weights of all the poles are equal, the surface has
/// a polynomial equation, and hence is a "non-rational surface".
/// The non-rational surface is a special, but frequently
/// used, case, where all poles have identical weights.
/// The weights are defined and used only in the case of
/// a rational surface. This rational characteristic is
/// defined in each parametric direction. Hence, a
/// surface can be rational in the u parametric direction,
/// and non-rational in the v parametric direction.
/// Likewise, the degree of a surface is defined in each
/// parametric direction. The degree of a Bezier surface
/// in a given parametric direction is equal to the number
/// of poles of the surface in that parametric direction,
/// minus 1. This must be greater than or equal to 1.
/// However, the degree for a Geom_BezierSurface is
/// limited to a value of (25) which is defined and
/// controlled by the system. This value is returned by the
/// function MaxDegree.
/// The parameter range for a Bezier surface is [ 0, 1 ]
/// in the two parametric directions.
/// A Bezier surface can also be closed, or open, in each
/// parametric direction. If the first row of poles is
/// identical to the last row of poles, the surface is closed
/// in the u parametric direction. If the first column of
/// poles is identical to the last column of poles, the
/// surface is closed in the v parametric direction.
/// The continuity of a Bezier surface is infinite in the u
/// parametric direction and the in v parametric direction.
/// Note: It is not possible to build a Bezier surface with
/// negative weights. Any weight value that is less than,
/// or equal to, gp::Resolution() is considered
/// to be zero. Two weight values, W1 and W2, are
/// considered equal if: |W2-W1| <= gp::Resolution()

//  Class  Geom_BSplineCurve
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// Definition of the B_spline curve.
/// A B-spline curve can be
/// Uniform  or non-uniform
/// Rational or non-rational
/// Periodic or non-periodic
/// 
/// a b-spline curve is defined by :
/// its degree; the degree for a
/// Geom_BSplineCurve is limited to a value (25)
/// which is defined and controlled by the system.
/// This value is returned by the function MaxDegree;
/// - its periodic or non-periodic nature;
/// - a table of poles (also called control points), with
/// their associated weights if the BSpline curve is
/// rational. The poles of the curve are "control
/// points" used to deform the curve. If the curve is
/// non-periodic, the first pole is the start point of
/// the curve, and the last pole is the end point of
/// the curve. The segment which joins the first pole
/// to the second pole is the tangent to the curve at
/// its start point, and the segment which joins the
/// last pole to the second-from-last pole is the
/// tangent to the curve at its end point. If the curve
/// is periodic, these geometric properties are not
/// verified. It is more difficult to give a geometric
/// signification to the weights but are useful for
/// providing exact representations of the arcs of a
/// circle or ellipse. Moreover, if the weights of all the
/// poles are equal, the curve has a polynomial
/// equation; it is therefore a non-rational curve.
/// - a table of knots with their multiplicities. For a
/// Geom_BSplineCurve, the table of knots is an
/// increasing sequence of reals without repetition;
/// the multiplicities define the repetition of the knots.
/// A BSpline curve is a piecewise polynomial or
/// rational curve. The knots are the parameters of
/// junction points between two pieces. The
/// multiplicity Mult(i) of the knot Knot(i) of
/// the BSpline curve is related to the degree of
/// continuity of the curve at the knot Knot(i),
/// which is equal to Degree - Mult(i)
/// where Degree is the degree of the BSpline curve.
/// If the knots are regularly spaced (i.e. the difference
/// between two consecutive knots is a constant), three
/// specific and frequently used cases of knot
/// distribution can be identified:
/// - "uniform" if all multiplicities are equal to 1,
/// - "quasi-uniform" if all multiplicities are equal to 1,
/// except the first and the last knot which have a
/// multiplicity of Degree + 1, where Degree is
/// the degree of the BSpline curve,
/// - "Piecewise Bezier" if all multiplicities are equal to
/// Degree except the first and last knot which
/// have a multiplicity of Degree + 1, where
/// Degree is the degree of the BSpline curve. A
/// curve of this type is a concatenation of arcs of Bezier curves.
/// If the BSpline curve is not periodic:
/// - the bounds of the Poles and Weights tables are 1
/// and NbPoles, where NbPoles is the number
/// of poles of the BSpline curve,
/// - the bounds of the Knots and Multiplicities tables
/// are 1 and NbKnots, where NbKnots is the
/// number of knots of the BSpline curve.
/// If the BSpline curve is periodic, and if there are k
/// periodic knots and p periodic poles, the period is:
/// period = Knot(k + 1) - Knot(1)
/// and the poles and knots tables can be considered
/// as infinite tables, verifying:
/// - Knot(i+k) = Knot(i) + period
/// - Pole(i+p) = Pole(i)
/// Note: data structures of a periodic BSpline curve
/// are more complex than those of a non-periodic one.
/// Warning
/// In this class, weight value is considered to be zero if
/// the weight is less than or equal to gp::Resolution().

//---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Class  Geom_BSplineSurface
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// Describes a BSpline surface.
/// In each parametric direction, a BSpline surface can be:
/// - uniform or non-uniform,
/// - rational or non-rational,
/// - periodic or non-periodic.
/// A BSpline surface is defined by:
/// - its degrees, in the u and v parametric directions,
/// - its periodic characteristic, in the u and v parametric directions,
/// - a table of poles, also called control points (together
/// with the associated weights if the surface is rational), and
/// - a table of knots, together with the associated multiplicities.
/// The degree of a Geom_BSplineSurface is limited to
/// a value (25) which is defined and controlled by the
/// system. This value is returned by the function MaxDegree.
/// Poles and Weights
/// Poles and Weights are manipulated using two associative double arrays:
/// - the poles table, which is a double array of gp_Pnt points, and
/// - the weights table, which is a double array of reals.
/// The bounds of the poles and weights arrays are:
/// - 1 and NbUPoles for the row bounds (provided
/// that the BSpline surface is not periodic in the u
/// parametric direction), where NbUPoles is the
/// number of poles of the surface in the u parametric direction, and
/// - 1 and NbVPoles for the column bounds (provided
/// that the BSpline surface is not periodic in the v
/// parametric direction), where NbVPoles is the
/// number of poles of the surface in the v parametric direction.
/// The poles of the surface are the points used to shape
/// and reshape the surface. They comprise a rectangular network.
/// If the surface is not periodic:
/// - The points (1, 1), (NbUPoles, 1), (1,
/// NbVPoles), and (NbUPoles, NbVPoles)
/// are the four parametric "corners" of the surface.
/// - The first column of poles and the last column of
/// poles define two BSpline curves which delimit the
/// surface in the v parametric direction. These are the
/// v isoparametric curves corresponding to the two
/// bounds of the v parameter.
/// - The first row of poles and the last row of poles
/// define two BSpline curves which delimit the surface
/// in the u parametric direction. These are the u
/// isoparametric curves corresponding to the two bounds of the u parameter.
/// If the surface is periodic, these geometric properties are not verified.
/// It is more difficult to define a geometrical significance
/// for the weights. However they are useful for
/// representing a quadric surface precisely. Moreover, if
/// the weights of all the poles are equal, the surface has
/// a polynomial equation, and hence is a "non-rational surface".
/// The non-rational surface is a special, but frequently
/// used, case, where all poles have identical weights.
/// The weights are defined and used only in the case of
/// a rational surface. The rational characteristic is
/// defined in each parametric direction. A surface can be
/// rational in the u parametric direction, and
/// non-rational in the v parametric direction.
/// Knots and Multiplicities
/// For a Geom_BSplineSurface the table of knots is
/// made up of two increasing sequences of reals, without
/// repetition, one for each parametric direction. The
/// multiplicities define the repetition of the knots.
/// A BSpline surface comprises multiple contiguous
/// patches, which are themselves polynomial or rational
/// surfaces. The knots are the parameters of the
/// isoparametric curves which limit these contiguous
/// patches. The multiplicity of a knot on a BSpline
/// surface (in a given parametric direction) is related to
/// the degree of continuity of the surface at that knot in
/// that parametric direction:
/// Degree of continuity at knot(i) = Degree - Multi(i) where:
/// - Degree is the degree of the BSpline surface in
/// the given parametric direction, and
/// - Multi(i) is the multiplicity of knot number i in
/// the given parametric direction.
/// There are some special cases, where the knots are
/// regularly spaced in one parametric direction (i.e. the
/// difference between two consecutive knots is a constant).
/// - "Uniform": all the multiplicities are equal to 1.
/// - "Quasi-uniform": all the multiplicities are equal to 1,
/// except for the first and last knots in this parametric
/// direction, and these are equal to Degree + 1.
/// - "Piecewise Bezier": all the multiplicities are equal to
/// Degree except for the first and last knots, which
/// are equal to Degree + 1. This surface is a
/// concatenation of Bezier patches in the given
/// parametric direction.
/// If the BSpline surface is not periodic in a given
/// parametric direction, the bounds of the knots and
/// multiplicities tables are 1 and NbKnots, where
/// NbKnots is the number of knots of the BSpline
/// surface in that parametric direction.
/// If the BSpline surface is periodic in a given parametric
/// direction, and there are k periodic knots and p
/// periodic poles in that parametric direction:
/// - the period is such that:
/// period = Knot(k+1) - Knot(1), and
/// - the poles and knots tables in that parametric
/// direction can be considered as infinite tables, such that:
/// Knot(i+k) = Knot(i) + period, and
/// Pole(i+p) = Pole(i)
/// Note: The data structure tables for a periodic BSpline
/// surface are more complex than those of a non-periodic one.

/// <summary>
/// Describes a surface of revolution (revolved surface).
/// Such a surface is obtained by rotating a curve (called
/// the "meridian") through a complete revolution about
/// an axis (referred to as the "axis of revolution"). The
/// curve and the axis must be in the same plane (the
/// "reference plane" of the surface).
/// Rotation around the axis of revolution in the
/// trigonometric sense defines the u parametric
/// direction. So the u parameter is an angle, and its
/// origin is given by the position of the meridian on the surface.
/// The parametric range for the u parameter is: [ 0, 2.*Pi ]
/// The v parameter is that of the meridian.
/// Note: A surface of revolution is built from a copy of the
/// original meridian. As a result the original meridian is
/// not modified when the surface is modified.
/// The form of a surface of revolution is typically a
/// general revolution surface
/// (GeomAbs_RevolutionForm). It can be:
/// - a conical surface, if the meridian is a line or a
/// trimmed line (GeomAbs_ConicalForm),
/// - a cylindrical surface, if the meridian is a line or a
/// trimmed line parallel to the axis of revolution
/// (GeomAbs_CylindricalForm),
/// - a planar surface if the meridian is a line or a
/// trimmed line perpendicular to the axis of revolution
/// of the surface (GeomAbs_PlanarForm),
/// - a toroidal surface, if the meridian is a circle or a
/// trimmed circle (GeomAbs_ToroidalForm), or
/// - a spherical surface, if the meridian is a circle, the
/// center of which is located on the axis of the
/// revolved surface (GeomAbs_SphericalForm).
/// Warning
/// Be careful not to construct a surface of revolution
/// where the curve and the axis or revolution are not
/// defined in the same plane. If you do not have a
/// correct configuration, you can correct your initial
/// curve, using a cylindrical projection in the reference plane.
