/// The history keeps the following relations between the input shapes
/// (S1, ..., Sm) and output shapes (T1, ..., Tn):
/// 1) an output shape Tj is generated from an input shape Si: Tj <= G(Si);
/// 2) a output shape Tj is modified from an input shape Si: Tj <= M(Si);
/// 3) an input shape (Si) is removed: R(Si) == 1.
/// 
/// The relations are kept only for shapes of types vertex, edge, face, and
/// solid.
/// 
/// The last relation means that:
/// 1) shape Si is not an output shape and
/// 2) no any shape is modified (produced) from shape Si:
/// R(Si) == 1 ==> Si != Tj, M(Si) == 0.
/// 
/// It means that the input shape cannot be removed and modified
/// simultaneously. However, the shapes may be generated from the
/// removed shape. For instance, in Fillet operation the edges
/// generate faces and then are removed.
/// 
/// No any shape could be generated and modified from the same shape
/// simultaneously: sets G(Si) and M(Si) are not intersected
/// (G(Si) ^ M(Si) == 0).
/// 
/// Each output shape should be:
/// 1) an input shape or
/// 2) generated or modified from an input shape (even generated from the
/// implicit null shape if necessary):
/// Tj == Si V (exists Si that Tj <= G(Si) U M(Si)).
/// 
/// Recommendations to choose between relations 'generated' and 'modified':
/// 1) a shape is generated from input shapes if it dimension is greater or
/// smaller than the dimensions of the input shapes;
/// 2) a shape is generated from input shapes if these shapes are also output
/// shapes;
/// 3) a shape is generated from input shapes of the same dimension if it is
/// produced by joining shapes generated from these shapes;
/// 4) a shape is modified from an input shape if it replaces the input shape by
/// changes of the location, the tolerance, the bounds of the parametric
/// space (the faces for a solid), the parametrization and/or by applying of
/// an approximation;
/// 5) a shape is modified from input shapes of the same dimension if it is
/// produced by joining shapes modified from these shapes.
/// 
/// Two sequential histories:
/// - one history (H12) of shapes S1, ..., Sm to shapes T1, ..., Tn and
/// - another history (H23) of shapes T1, ..., Tn to shapes Q1, ..., Ql
/// could be merged to the single history (H13) of shapes S1, ..., Sm to shapes
/// Q1, ..., Ql.
/// 
/// During the merge:
/// 1) if shape Tj is generated from shape Si then each shape generated or
/// modified from shape Tj is considered as a shape generated from shape Si
/// among shapes Q1, ..., Ql:
/// Tj <= G12(Si), Qk <= G23(Tj) U M23(Tj) ==> Qk <= G13(Si).
/// 2) if shape Tj is modified from shape Si, shape Qk is generated from shape
/// Tj then shape Qk is considered as a shape generated from shape Si among
/// shapes Q1, ..., Ql:
/// Tj <= M12(Si), Qk <= G23(Tj) ==> Qk <= G13(Si);
/// 3) if shape Tj is modified from shape Si, shape Qk is modified from shape
/// Tj then shape Qk is considered as a shape modified from shape Si among
