//---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Class  Geom2d_BSplineCurve
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// Describes a BSpline curve.
/// A BSpline curve can be:
/// - uniform or non-uniform,
/// - rational or non-rational,
/// - periodic or non-periodic.
/// A BSpline curve is defined by:
/// - its degree; the degree for a
/// Geom2d_BSplineCurve is limited to a value (25)
/// which is defined and controlled by the system. This
/// value is returned by the function MaxDegree;
/// - its periodic or non-periodic nature;
/// - a table of poles (also called control points), with
/// their associated weights if the BSpline curve is
/// rational. The poles of the curve are "control points"
/// used to deform the curve. If the curve is
/// non-periodic, the first pole is the start point of the
/// curve, and the last pole is the end point of the
/// curve. The segment, which joins the first pole to the
/// second pole, is the tangent to the curve at its start
/// point, and the segment, which joins the last pole to
/// the second-from-last pole, is the tangent to the
/// curve at its end point. If the curve is periodic, these
/// geometric properties are not verified. It is more
/// difficult to give a geometric signification to the
/// weights but they are useful for providing exact
/// representations of the arcs of a circle or ellipse.
/// Moreover, if the weights of all the poles are equal,
/// the curve has a polynomial equation; it is
/// therefore a non-rational curve.
/// - a table of knots with their multiplicities. For a
/// Geom2d_BSplineCurve, the table of knots is an
/// increasing sequence of reals without repetition; the
/// multiplicities define the repetition of the knots. A
/// BSpline curve is a piecewise polynomial or rational
/// curve. The knots are the parameters of junction
/// points between two pieces. The multiplicity
/// Mult(i) of the knot Knot(i) of the BSpline
/// curve is related to the degree of continuity of the
/// curve at the knot Knot(i), which is equal to
/// Degree - Mult(i) where Degree is the
/// degree of the BSpline curve.
/// If the knots are regularly spaced (i.e. the difference
/// between two consecutive knots is a constant), three
/// specific and frequently used cases of knot distribution
/// can be identified:
/// - "uniform" if all multiplicities are equal to 1,
/// - "quasi-uniform" if all multiplicities are equal to 1,
/// except the first and the last knot which have a
/// multiplicity of Degree + 1, where Degree is
/// the degree of the BSpline curve,
/// - "Piecewise Bezier" if all multiplicities are equal to
/// Degree except the first and last knot which have
/// a multiplicity of Degree + 1, where Degree is
/// the degree of the BSpline curve. A curve of this
/// type is a concatenation of arcs of Bezier curves.
/// If the BSpline curve is not periodic:
/// - the bounds of the Poles and Weights tables are 1
/// and NbPoles, where NbPoles is the number of
/// poles of the BSpline curve,
/// - the bounds of the Knots and Multiplicities tables are
/// 1 and NbKnots, where NbKnots is the number
/// of knots of the BSpline curve.
/// If the BSpline curve is periodic, and if there are k
/// periodic knots and p periodic poles, the period is:
/// period = Knot(k + 1) - Knot(1)
/// and the poles and knots tables can be considered as
/// infinite tables, such that:
/// - Knot(i+k) = Knot(i) + period
/// - Pole(i+p) = Pole(i)
/// Note: data structures of a periodic BSpline curve are
/// more complex than those of a non-periodic one.
/// Warnings :
/// In this class we consider that a weight value is zero if
/// Weight <= Resolution from package gp.
/// For two parametric values (or two knot values) U1, U2 we
/// consider that U1 = U2 if Abs (U2 - U1) <= Epsilon (U1).
/// For two weights values W1, W2 we consider that W1 = W2 if
/// Abs (W2 - W1) <= Epsilon (W1).  The method Epsilon is
/// defined in the class Real from package Standard.
