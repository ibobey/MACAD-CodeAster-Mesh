/// <summary>
/// The   GeomAPI   package  provides  an  Application
/// Programming Interface for the Geometry.
/// 
/// The API is a set of  classes and methods aiming to
/// provide :
/// 
/// * High level and simple calls  for the most common
/// operations.
/// 
/// *    Keeping   an   access  on    the    low-level
/// implementation of high-level calls.
/// 
/// The API  provides classes to  call the algorithms
/// of the Geometry
/// 
/// * The  constructors  of the classes  provides  the
/// different constructions methods.
/// 
/// * The  class keeps as fields the   different tools
/// used by the algorithms
/// 
/// *   The class  provides  a  casting  method to get
/// automatically the  result  with  a   function-like
/// call.
/// 
/// For example to evaluate the distance <D> between a
/// point <P> and a curve <C>, one can writes :
/// 
/// D = GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnCurve(P,C);
/// 
/// or
/// 
/// GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnCurve PonC(P,C);
/// D = PonC.LowerDistance();

/// <summary>
/// This class is used to approximate or interpolate
/// a BSplineSurface passing through an  Array2 of
/// points, with a given continuity.
/// Describes functions for building a BSpline
/// surface which approximates or interpolates a set of points.
/// A PointsToBSplineSurface object provides a framework for:
/// -   defining the data of the BSpline surface to be built,
/// -   implementing the approximation algorithm
/// or the interpolation algorithm, and consulting the results.
/// In fact, class contains 3 algorithms, 2 for approximation and 1
/// for interpolation.
/// First approximation algorithm is based on usual least square criterium:
/// minimization of square distance between samplimg points and result surface.
/// Second approximation algorithm uses least square criterium and additional
/// minimization of some local characteristic of surface (first, second and third
/// partial derivative), which allows managing shape of surface.
/// Interpolation algorithm produces surface, which passes through sampling points.
/// 
/// There is accordance between parametrization of result surface S(U, V) and
/// indexes of array Points(i, j): first index corresponds U parameter of surface,
/// second - V parameter of surface.
/// So, points of any j-th column Points(*, j) represent any V isoline of surface,
/// points of any i-th row Point(i, *) represent any U isoline of surface.
/// 
/// For each sampling point parameters U, V are calculated according to
/// type of parametrization, which can be Approx_ChordLength, Approx_Centripetal
/// or Approx_IsoParametric. Default value is Approx_ChordLength.
/// For ChordLength parametrisation U(i) = U(i-1) + P(i).Distance(P(i-1)),
/// For Centripetal type  U(i) = U(i-1) + Sqrt(P(i).Distance(P(i-1))).
/// Centripetal type can get better result for irregular distances between points.
/// 
/// Approximation and interpolation algorithms can build periodical surface along U
/// direction, which corresponds columns of array Points(i, j),
/// if corresponding parameter (thePeriodic, see comments below) of called
/// methods is set to True. Algorithm uses first row Points(1, *) as periodic boundary,
/// so to avoid getting wrong surface it is necessary to keep distance between
/// corresponding points of first and last rows of Points:
/// Points(1, *) != Points(Upper, *).
