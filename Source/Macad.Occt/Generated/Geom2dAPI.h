//  Class  Geom2dAPI_ExtremaCurveCurve
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// Describes functions for computing all the extrema
/// between two 2D curves.
/// An ExtremaCurveCurve algorithm minimizes or
/// maximizes the distance between a point on the first
/// curve and a point on the second curve. Thus, it
/// computes the start point and end point of
/// perpendiculars common to the two curves (an
/// intersection point is not an extremum except where
/// the two curves are tangential at this point).
/// Solutions consist of pairs of points, and an extremum
/// is considered to be a segment joining the two points of a solution.
/// An ExtremaCurveCurve object provides a framework for:
/// -   defining the construction of the extrema,
/// -   implementing the construction algorithm, and
/// -   consulting the results.
/// Warning
/// In some cases, the nearest points between two
/// curves do not correspond to one of the computed
/// extrema. Instead, they may be given by:
/// -   a limit point of one curve and one of the following:
/// -   its orthogonal projection on the other curve,
/// -   a limit point of the other curve; or
/// -   an intersection point between the two curves.
