/// The class contains API level of the General Fuse algorithm.<br>
/// 
/// Additionally to the options defined in the base class, the algorithm has
/// the following options:<br>
/// - *Safe processing mode* - allows to avoid modification of the input
/// shapes during the operation (by default it is off);
/// - *Gluing options* - allows to speed up the calculation of the intersections
/// on the special cases, in which some sub-shapes are coinciding.
/// - *Disabling the check for inverted solids* - Disables/Enables the check of the input solids
/// for inverted status (holes in the space). The default value is TRUE,
/// i.e. the check is performed. Setting this flag to FALSE for inverted
/// solids, most likely will lead to incorrect results.
/// - *Disabling history collection* - allows disabling the collection of the history
/// of shapes modifications during the operation.
/// 
/// It returns the following Error statuses:<br>
/// - 0 - in case of success;<br>
/// - *BOPAlgo_AlertTooFewArguments* - in case there are no enough arguments to perform the
/// operation;<br>
/// - *BOPAlgo_AlertIntersectionFailed* - in case the intersection of the arguments has failed;<br>
/// - *BOPAlgo_AlertBuilderFailed* - in case building of the result shape has failed.<br>
/// 
/// Warnings statuses from underlying DS Filler and Builder algorithms
/// are collected in the report.
/// 
/// The class provides possibility to simplify the resulting shape by unification
/// of the tangential edges and faces. It is performed by the method *SimplifyResult*.
/// See description of this method for more details.

//  Class  BRepAlgoAPI_Defeaturing
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// The BRepAlgoAPI_Defeaturing algorithm is the API algorithm intended for
/// removal of the unwanted parts from the shape. The unwanted parts
/// (or features) can be holes, protrusions, gaps, chamfers, fillets etc.
/// The shape itself is not modified, the new shape is built as the result.
/// 
/// The actual removal of the features from the shape is performed by
/// the low-level *BOPAlgo_RemoveFeatures* tool. So the defeaturing algorithm
/// has the same options, input data requirements, limitations as the
/// low-level algorithm.
/// 
/// <b>Input data</b>
/// 
/// Currently, only the shapes of type SOLID, COMPSOLID, and COMPOUND of Solids
/// are supported. And only the FACEs can be removed from the shape.
/// 
/// On the input the algorithm accepts the shape itself and the
/// features which have to be removed. It does not matter how the features
/// are given. It could be the separate faces or the collections
/// of faces. The faces should belong to the initial shape, and those that
/// do not belong will be ignored.
/// 
/// <b>Options</b>
/// 
/// The algorithm has the following options:
/// - History support;
/// 
/// and the options available from base class:
/// - Error/Warning reporting system;
/// - Parallel processing mode.
/// 
/// Please note that the other options of the base class are not supported
/// here and will have no effect.
/// 
/// For the details on the available options please refer to the description
/// of *BOPAlgo_RemoveFeatures* algorithm.
/// 
/// <b>Limitations</b>
/// 
/// The defeaturing algorithm has the same limitations as *BOPAlgo_RemoveFeatures*
/// algorithm.
/// 
/// <b>Example</b>
/// 
/// Here is the example of usage of the algorithm:
/// ~~~~
/// TopoDS_Shape aSolid = ...;               // Input shape to remove the features from
/// TopTools_ListOfShape aFeatures = ...;    // Features to remove from the shape
/// Standard_Boolean bRunParallel = ...;     // Parallel processing mode
/// Standard_Boolean isHistoryNeeded = ...;  // History support
/// 
/// BRepAlgoAPI_Defeaturing aDF;             // De-Featuring algorithm
/// aDF.SetShape(aSolid);                    // Set the shape
/// aDF.AddFacesToRemove(aFaces);            // Add faces to remove
/// aDF.SetRunParallel(bRunParallel);        // Define the processing mode (parallel or single)
/// aDF.SetToFillHistory(isHistoryNeeded);   // Define whether to track the shapes modifications
/// aDF.Build();                             // Perform the operation
/// if (!aDF.IsDone())                       // Check for the errors
/// {
/// // error treatment
/// Standard_SStream aSStream;
/// aDF.DumpErrors(aSStream);
/// return;
/// }
/// if (aDF.HasWarnings())                   // Check for the warnings
/// {
/// // warnings treatment
/// Standard_SStream aSStream;
/// aDF.DumpWarnings(aSStream);
/// }
/// const TopoDS_Shape& aResult = aDF.Shape(); // Result shape
/// ~~~~
/// 
/// The algorithm preserves the type of the input shape in the result shape. Thus,
/// if the input shape is a COMPSOLID, the resulting solids will also be put into a COMPSOLID.
