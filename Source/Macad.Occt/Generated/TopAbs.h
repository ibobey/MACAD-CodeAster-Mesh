/// <summary>
/// Identifies the orientation of a topological shape.
/// Orientation can represent a relation between two
/// entities, or it can apply to a shape in its own right.
/// When used to describe a relation between two
/// shapes, orientation allows you to use the underlying
/// entity in either direction. For example on a curve
/// which is oriented FORWARD (say from left to right)
/// you can have both a FORWARD and a REVERSED
/// edge. The FORWARD edge will be oriented from
/// left to right, and the REVERSED edge from right to
/// left. In this way, you share the underlying entity. In
/// other words, two faces of a cube can share an
/// edge, and can also be used to build compound shapes.
/// For each case in which an element is used as the
/// boundary of a geometric domain of a higher
/// dimension, this element defines two local regions of
/// which one is arbitrarily considered as the default
/// region. A change in orientation implies a switch of
/// default region. This allows you to apply changes of
/// orientation to the shape as a whole.

/// faces. This expands the notions of WIRE and SHELL to solids.
/// - SOLID: A part of 3D space bounded by shells.
/// - SHELL: A set of faces connected by some of the
/// edges of their wire boundaries. A shell can be open or closed.
/// - FACE: Part of a plane (in 2D geometry) or a surface
/// (in 3D geometry) bounded by a closed wire. Its
/// geometry is constrained (trimmed) by contours.
/// - WIRE: A sequence of edges connected by their
/// vertices. It can be open or closed depending on
/// whether the edges are linked or not.
/// - EDGE: A single dimensional shape corresponding
/// to a curve, and bound by a vertex at each extremity.
/// - VERTEX: A zero-dimensional shape corresponding to a point in geometry.
