/// 
/// This class works on two distinct types of shapes when analyzing

/// 1. compound of faces.

/// 2. compound of shells.
/// Actual free bounds (edges shared by the only face in the shell)
/// are output in this case. ShapeAnalysis_Shell is used for that.

/// When connecting edges into the wires algorithm tries to build

/// to extract closed sub-contours out of closed and/or open contours.
/// 
/// Free bounds are returned as two compounds, one for closed and one
/// for open wires.

/// This class also provides some static methods for advanced use:
/// connecting edges/wires to wires, extracting closed sub-wires out
/// of wires, dispatching wires into compounds for closed and open

//  Class  ShapeAnalysis_Wire
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// This class provides analysis of a wire to be compliant to
/// CAS.CADE requirements.
/// 
/// The functionalities provided are the following:
/// 1. consistency of 2d and 3d edge curve senses
/// 2. connection of adjacent edges regarding to:
/// a. their vertices
/// b. their pcurves
/// c. their 3d curves
/// 3. adjacency of the edge vertices to its pcurve and 3d curve
/// 4. if a wire is closed or not (considering its 3d and 2d
/// contour)
/// 5. if a wire is outer on its face (considering pcurves)
/// 
/// This class can be used in conjunction with class
/// ShapeFix_Wire, which will fix the problems detected by this class.
/// 
/// The methods of the given class match to ones of the class
/// ShapeFix_Wire, e.g., CheckSmall and FixSmall.
/// This class also includes some auxiliary methods
/// (e.g., CheckOuterBound, etc.),
/// which have no pair in ShapeFix_Wire.
/// 
/// Like methods of ShapeFix_Wire the ones of this class are
/// grouped into two levels:
/// - Public which are recommended for use (the most global
/// method is Perform),
/// - Advanced, for optional use only
/// 
/// For analyzing result of Public API checking methods use
/// corresponding Status... method.
/// The 'advanced' functions share the single status field which
/// contains the result of the last performed 'advanced' method.
/// It is queried by the method LastCheckStatus().
/// 
/// In order to prepare an analyzer, it is necessary to load a wire,
/// set face and precision.
