/// face, or creating a shape corresponding to face on composite
/// surface which is missing in CAS.CADE but exists in some other
/// systems.
/// 
/// It splits (if necessary) original face to several ones by
/// splitting lines which are joint lines on a supplied grid of
/// surfaces (U- and V- isolines of the  composite surface).
/// There are two modes of work, which differ in the way of
/// handling faces on periodic surfaces:
/// 
/// - if ClosedMode is False (default), when splitting itself is
/// done as if surface were not periodic. The periodicity of the
/// underlying surface is taken into account by duplicating splitting
/// lines in the periodic direction, as necessary to split all
/// the wires (whole parametrical range of a face)
/// In this mode, some regularization procedures are performed
/// (indexation of split segments by patch numbers), and it is
/// expected to be more reliable and robust in case of bad shapes
/// 
/// - if ClosedMode is True, when everything on a periodic surfaces
/// is considered as modulo period. This allows to deal with wires
/// which are closed in 3d but not in 2d, with wires which may be
/// shifted on several periods in 2d etc. However, this mode is
/// less reliable since some regularizations do not work for it.
/// 
/// The work is made basing on pcurves of the edges. These pcurves
/// should already exist (for example, in the case of division of
/// existing face), then they are taken as is. The existing pcurves
/// should be assigned to one surface (face) for all edges,
/// this surface (face) will be used only for accessing pcurves,
/// and it may have any geometry.
/// 
/// All the modifications are recorded in the context tool
/// (ShapeBuild_ReShape).

/// 
/// These are methods Fix...(), organised in two levels:
/// 
/// Level 1: Advanced - each method in this level fixes one separate problem,
/// usually dealing with either single edge or connection of the
/// two adjacent edges. These methods should be used carefully and
/// called in right sequence, because some of them depend on others.
/// 
/// Level 2: Public (API) - methods which group several methods of level 1
/// and call them in a proper sequence in order to make some
/// consistent set of fixes for a whole wire. It is possible to
/// control calls to methods of the advanced level from methods of
/// the public level by use of flags Fix..Mode() (see below).
/// 
/// Fixes can be made in three ways:
/// 1. Increasing tolerance of an edge or a vertex
/// 2. Changing topology (adding/removing/replacing edge in the wire
/// and/or replacing the vertex in the edge)
/// 3. Changing geometry (shifting vertex or adjusting ends of edge
/// curve to vertices, or recomputing curves of the edge)
/// 
/// When fix can be made in more than one way (e.g., either
/// by increasing tolerance or shifting a vertex), it is chosen
/// according to the flags:
/// ModifyTopologyMode - allows modification of the topology.
/// This flag can be set when fixing a wire on
/// the separate (free) face, and should be
/// unset for face which is part of shell.
/// ModifyGeometryMode - allows modification of the geometry.
/// 
/// The order of descriptions of Fix() methods in this CDL
/// approximately corresponds to the optimal order of calls.
/// 
/// NOTE: most of fixing methods expect edges in the
/// ShapeExtend_WireData to be ordered, so it is necessary to make
/// call to FixReorder() before any other fixes
/// 
/// ShapeFix_Wire should be initialized prior to any fix by the
/// following data:
/// a) Wire (ether TopoDS_Wire or ShapeExtend_Wire)
/// b) Face or surface
/// c) Precision
/// d) Maximal tail angle and width
/// This can be done either by calling corresponding methods

/// (free bounds are the wires consisting of edges referenced by the
/// only face).
/// For building free bounds it uses ShapeAnalysis_FreeBounds class.
/// This class complements it with the feature to reduce the number
/// of open wires.
/// This reduction is performed with help of connecting several
/// adjacent open wires one to another what can lead to:
/// 1. making an open wire with greater length out of several
/// open wires
/// 2. making closed wire out of several open wires
/// 
/// The connecting open wires is performed with a user-given
/// tolerance.
/// 
/// When connecting several open wires into one wire their previous
/// end vertices are replaced with new connecting vertices. After
/// that all the edges in the shape sharing previous vertices inside
/// the shape are updated with new vertices. Thus source shape can
/// be modified.
/// 
/// Since interface of this class is the same as one of
/// ShapeAnalysis_FreeBounds refer to its CDL for details.
