/// <summary>
/// The GeomConvert package provides some global functions as follows
/// -   converting classical Geom curves into BSpline curves,
/// -   segmenting BSpline curves, particularly at knots
/// values: this function may be used in conjunction with the
/// GeomConvert_BSplineCurveKnotSplitting
/// class to segment a BSpline curve into arcs which
/// comply with required continuity levels,
/// -   converting classical Geom surfaces into BSpline surfaces, and
/// -   segmenting BSpline surfaces, particularly at
/// knots values: this function may be used in conjunction with the
/// GeomConvert_BSplineSurfaceKnotSplitting
/// class to segment a BSpline surface into patches
/// which comply with required continuity levels.
/// All geometric entities used in this package are bounded.
