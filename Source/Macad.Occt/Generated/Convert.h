//  Enum  Convert_ParameterisationType
//---------------------------------------------------------------------
/// <summary>
/// Identifies a type of parameterization of a circle or ellipse represented as a BSpline curve.
/// For a circle with a center C and a radius R (for example a Geom2d_Circle or a Geom_Circle),
/// the natural parameterization is angular. It uses the angle Theta made by the vector CM with
/// the 'X Axis' of the circle's local coordinate system as parameter for the current point M. The
/// coordinates of the point M are as follows:
/// X   =   R *cos ( Theta )
/// y   =   R * sin ( Theta )
/// Similarly, for an ellipse with a center C, a major radius R and a minor radius r, the circle
/// Circ with center C and radius R (and located in the same plane as the ellipse) lends its natural
/// angular parameterization to the ellipse. This is achieved by an affine transformation in the
/// plane of the ellipse, in the ratio r / R, about the 'X Axis' of its local coordinate system. The
/// coordinates of the current point M are as follows:
/// X   =   R * cos ( Theta )
/// y   =   r * sin ( Theta )
/// The process of converting a circle or an ellipse into a rational or non-rational BSpline curve
/// transforms the Theta angular parameter into a parameter t. This ensures the rational or
/// polynomial parameterization of the resulting BSpline curve. Several types of parametric
/// transformations are available.
/// TgtThetaOver2
/// The most usual method is Convert_TgtThetaOver2 where the parameter t on the BSpline
/// curve is obtained by means of transformation of the following type:
/// t = tan ( Theta / 2 )
/// The result of this definition is:
/// cos ( Theta ) = ( 1. - t**2 ) / ( 1. + t**2 )
/// sin ( Theta ) =      2. * t / ( 1. + t**2 )
/// which ensures the rational parameterization of the circle or the ellipse. However, this is not
/// the most suitable parameterization method where the arc of the circle or ellipse has a large
/// opening angle. In such cases, the curve will be represented by a BSpline with intermediate
/// knots. Each span, i.e. each portion of curve between two different knot values, will use
/// parameterization of this type. The number of spans is calculated using the following rule: ( 1.2
/// * Delta / Pi ) + 1 where Delta is equal to the opening angle (in radians) of the arc of the
/// circle (Delta is equal to 2.* Pi in the case of a complete circle). The resulting BSpline curve
/// is "exact", i.e. computing any point of parameter t on the BSpline curve gives an exact point on
/// the circle or the ellipse. TgtThetaOver2_N Where N is equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4, this ensures the
/// same type of parameterization as Convert_TgtThetaOver2 but sets the number of spans in the
/// resulting BSpline curve to N rather than allowing the algorithm to make this calculation.
/// However, the opening angle Delta (parametric angle, given in radians) of the arc of the circle
/// (or of the ellipse) must comply with the following:
/// -   Delta <= 0.9999 * Pi for the Convert_TgtThetaOver2_1 method, or
/// -   Delta <= 1.9999 * Pi for the Convert_TgtThetaOver2_2 method.
/// QuasiAngular
/// The Convert_QuasiAngular method of parameterization uses a different type of rational
/// parameterization. This method ensures that the parameter t along the resulting BSpline curve is
/// very close to the natural parameterization angle Theta of the circle or ellipse (i.e. which uses
/// the functions sin ( Theta ) and cos ( Theta ).
/// The resulting BSpline curve is "exact", i.e. computing any point of parameter t on the BSpline
/// curve gives an exact point on the circle or the ellipse.
/// RationalC1
/// The Convert_RationalC1 method of parameterization uses a further type of rational
/// parameterization. This method ensures that the equation relating to the resulting BSpline curve
/// has a "C1" continuous denominator, which is not the case with the above methods. RationalC1
/// enhances the degree of continuity at the junction point of the different spans of the curve.
/// The resulting BSpline curve is "exact", i.e. computing any point of parameter t on the BSpline
/// curve gives an exact point on the circle or the ellipse.
/// Polynomial
/// The Convert_Polynomial method is used to produce polynomial (i.e. non-rational)
/// parameterization of the resulting BSpline curve with 8 poles (i.e. a polynomial degree equal to
/// 7). However, the result is an approximation of the circle or ellipse (i.e. computing the point
/// of parameter t on the BSpline curve does not give an exact point on the circle or the ellipse).
