/// <summary>
/// An Explorer is a Tool to visit  a Topological Data
/// Structure form the TopoDS package.
/// 
/// An Explorer is built with :
/// 
/// * The Shape to explore.
/// 
/// * The type of Shapes to find : e.g VERTEX, EDGE.
/// This type cannot be SHAPE.
/// 
/// * The type of Shapes to avoid. e.g  SHELL, EDGE.
/// By default   this type is  SHAPE which  means no
/// restriction on the exploration.
/// 
/// The Explorer  visits  all the  structure   to find
/// shapes of the   requested  type  which   are   not
/// contained in the type to avoid.
/// 
/// Example to find all the Faces in the Shape S :
/// 
/// TopExp_Explorer Ex;
/// for (Ex.Init(S,TopAbs_FACE); Ex.More(); Ex.Next()) {
/// ProcessFace(Ex.Current());
/// }
/// 
/// // an other way
/// TopExp_Explorer Ex(S,TopAbs_FACE);
/// while (Ex.More()) {
/// ProcessFace(Ex.Current());
/// Ex.Next();
/// }
/// 
/// To find all the vertices which are not in an edge :
/// 
/// for (Ex.Init(S,TopAbs_VERTEX,TopAbs_EDGE); ...)
/// 
/// To  find all the faces  in   a SHELL, then all the
/// faces not in a SHELL :
/// 
/// TopExp_Explorer Ex1, Ex2;
/// 
/// for (Ex1.Init(S,TopAbs_SHELL),...) {
/// // visit all shells
/// for (Ex2.Init(Ex1.Current(),TopAbs_FACE),...) {
/// // visit all the faces of the current shell
/// }
/// }
/// 
/// for (Ex1.Init(S,TopAbs_FACE,TopAbs_SHELL),...) {
/// // visit all faces not in a shell
/// }
/// 
/// If   the type  to avoid  is   the same  or is less
/// complex than the type to find it has no effect.
/// 
/// For example searching edges  not in a vertex  does
/// not make a difference.
