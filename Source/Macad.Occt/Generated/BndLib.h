/// The BndLib package provides functions to add a geometric primitive to a bounding box.

/// similar to that which they infer for the equivalent Geom or Geom2d objects.
/// Add : Package to compute the bounding boxes for elementary
/// objects from gp in 2d and 3d .
/// 
/// AddCurve2d : A class to compute the bounding box for a curve
/// in 2d dimensions ;the curve is defined by a tool
/// 
/// AddCurve : A class to compute the bounding box for a curve
/// in 3d dimensions ;the curve is defined by a tool

/// AddSurface : A class to compute the bounding box for a surface.
